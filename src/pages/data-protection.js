      <h3>This site</h3>
      <p>
        We consider data protection to be very important. Therefore, the use of
        this website is possible without offering person-related information.
      </p>
      <p>
        This site is a personal and non-commercial website organized and
        maintained by Firstname Lastname. As such this site has no intention to
        gather and process any person-related data. Therefore this site in
        itself does not use Google analytics, trackers, advertising or marketing
        hooks.
      </p>
      <p>
        Furthermore, this site does not offer newsletters or contact forms and
        the owner of this site does not store any person-related information in
        connection to this site.

      <h3>Hosting and internet provider</h3>
      <p>
        However, like all other websites this site is hosted by an internet
        provider. In the case of this site the internet provider is{" "}
        <a href="https://netlify.com" target="_blank">
          netlify.com
        </a>. Netlify is using common internet technologies, such as cookies and
        web server logs for monitoring access to this website.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most internet providers are generating log files that usually contain
        the visitor’s browser type, language preference, referring site,
        additional websites requested, the date and time of each visitor request
        and potentially personally-identifying information like Internet
        Protocol (IP) addresses.
      </p>
      <p>
        The reason for doing so is to better understand how visitors use the
        website, and to monitor and protect the security of the website.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please read more about{" "}
