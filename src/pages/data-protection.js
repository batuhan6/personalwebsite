      <h3>This site</h3>
      <p>
        We consider data protection to be very important. Therefore, the use of
        this website is possible without offering person-related information.
      </p>
      <p>
        This site is a personal and non-commercial website organized and
        maintained by Firstname Lastname. As such this site has no intention to
        gather and process any person-related data. Therefore this site in
        itself does not use Google analytics, trackers, advertising or marketing
        hooks.
      </p>
      <p>
        Furthermore, this site does not offer newsletters or contact forms and
        the owner of this site does not store any person-related information in
        connection to this site.

      <h3>Hosting and internet provider</h3>
      <p>
        However, like all other websites this site is hosted by an internet
        provider. In the case of this site the internet provider is{" "}
        <a href="https://netlify.com" target="_blank">
          netlify.com
        </a>. Netlify is using common internet technologies, such as cookies and
        web server logs for monitoring access to this website.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most internet providers are generating log files that usually contain
        the visitorâ€™s browser type, language preference, referring site,
        additional websites requested, the date and time of each visitor request
        and potentially personally-identifying information like Internet
        Protocol (IP) addresses.
      </p>
      <p>
        The reason for doing so is to better understand how visitors use the
        website, and to monitor and protect the security of the website.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please read more about{" "}
        <a href="https://www.netlify.com/privacy/">
